# Paris weather prediction

**DATA**

Weather data is downloaded from [Darksky](https://darksky.net/dev). The first 1000 accesses are totally free, but after that, the service will be shut down, unless one provides the payment method. 

I kept downloading data from the server for free regularly, so one can find the weather data of about 4 years in the [data folder](https://github.com/SamWongML/weather_in_Paris/tree/master/data).
